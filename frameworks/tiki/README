Tiki is a lightweight CommonJS loader.  To use tiki, require it before all 
other frameworks in your application and then turn on module and loader 
support in your Buildfile.

== Tiki Loader

The tiki loader is a self-contained framework that implements a simple module
loader for JS.  You can register packages, which map to one or more scripts 
that must be loaded.  Each script can contain zero or more modules, which 
must be registered separately.

The loader has the ability to track dependencies between packages and modules
so that loading one package will automatically load any dependent package as 
well.

Additionally, the loader supports the concept of a "sandbox", which actually
manages instances of particular modules.  You can theoretically use sandboxes
to isolate code into segments that can only access modules they are allowed
to directly manipulate.

== Other Frameworks

Aside from the code loader, tiki also includes a system framework and one or
more platform frameworks as well.  

The system framework contains standard low-level JavaScript libraries for use 
in your application.  These libraries are designed around providing simple 
services, optimized for performance and memory usage.

The platform frameworks implement a common API across multiple JS platforms.
Currently the primary platforms under development are:

  - classic: implements the platform API for traditional desktop-based 
             browsers, including IE
             
  - html5:   implements the platform API for modern HTML5 browsers only, 
             including MobileSafari, Fennec, and late versions of WebKit and
             Firefox.  You can choose to use this platform if you can exclude
             IE8 or earlier.
  
  - server:  This is an experimental platform for JS-servers such as Narwhal
