Project:   Tiki

=============================================================================

Tiki is a lightweight implementation of CommonJS for the web browser.  It 
includes a simple module loader and package manager along with some of the 
default modules defined in the CommonJS spec.

The purpose of this project is to provide a very basic version of CommonJS 
that can be used in a wide array of projects.

Tiki is small and it can be safely loaded more than once so you can embed it 
at the front of any JavaScript package that might require it.
