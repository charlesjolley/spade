  A Reactor is a very simple event handling queue.  You can use the reactor
  to queue events or actions that you want to process.  You can create as many
  reactors as you want, but usually you will actually use just the built-in
  default reactor provided by this module.
  
  To schedule an action to run in the reactor, you can call either next() or
  after().  next() will execute the action immediately at the end of the 
  current event loop.  after() will execute the action after a specified 
  period of time.
  
  For this to work, you must implement a platform/timer module which can 
  fire a return action after a set amount of time.  Note that the 
  system/timer functionality is actually implemented on top of the reactor,
  not directly on top of the platform/timer.  This way it can take advantage
  of the queing here.
